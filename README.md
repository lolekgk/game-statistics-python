Story

You are a software architect at game development company named Eastwood Studios. Judy, a colleague from sales, asks you to help her in a competitor evaluation project. She has lots of data files with statistical information about famous games of all time. Judy has some unanswered questions about the games and expects you to write a program that can answer these questions.

There is an additional request: Judy likes to explore the data manually, and for that she needs a simple terminal interface where she can pick her questions, type the required inputs, and get the answer printed on the screen. On the other hand, there are many files that need to be processed, so you also need a way to answer the questions programmatically and save them into a target file.

Since you are an architect, you cannot help but use a modular structure, where no code is duplicated, and the responsibilities are strictly separated. So you decide to create three modules: reports, printing, and export to cover all the requested features.
